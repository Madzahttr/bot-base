# Bot Base

> A simple Discord.js bot base.

This is an extremely simple Discord.js bot base with a config loader / validator, a command handler, and a simple ping command. All code should be pretty self-explanatory.

## Hack the Source, Luke!

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your newly made fork
3. Run `npm ci` to install all dependecies
4. Copy the `.env.example` file that is provided to `.env` and fill out all provided variables
5. Run the bot with `npm start`

It should be pretty simple to make your own commands, expand the command handler, etc.

It would be appreciated if you would provide a link back to this original version though, as well as an optional link to [Rayzr's Discord server](https://rayzr.dev/join).
